   <h2>  Discription of my games in school  </h2>
   <dl> 
    <dt> Rugby </dt>
    <dd> Rugby is a contact team sport played with an oval-shaped ball, where the objective is to score points by carrying, passing, or kicking the ball into the opposing team's territory. It originated in England in the early 19th century and has since evolved into two main versions: Rugby Union and Rugby League, each with its own set of rules.</dd>
    <dt> Football </dt>
    <dd> Football" is a term used to describe several different team sports, but it most commonly refers to association football, known in the United States and Canada as soccer. Depending on the country, "football" can also refer to other forms of the sport, such as American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, and rugby football.</dd>
    <dt> Basketball </dt>
    <dd> Basketball is a fast-paced team sport played between two teams, typically consisting of five players each, on a rectangular court. The objective is to score points by shooting a basketball through the opponent's hoop (a net-like structure mounted 10 feet above the ground) while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</dd>
    <dt> Volleyball </dt>
    <dd>Volleyball is a team sport played by two opposing teams, usually consisting of six players each, who try to score points by sending a ball over a net and into the opponent's court. The ball is typically hit using the hands, arms, or other parts of the body, but not caught or thrown. Each team has three hits to return the ball to the other side, and the objective is to make the ball land in the opposing team's court or force an error.</dd>
    <dt> Tennis </dt>
    <dd>Tennis is a racket sport played between two individuals (singles) or two teams of two players each (doubles), where the objective is to hit a ball over a net into the opponent's side of the court in such a way that they cannot return it or fail to do so within the rules. It can be played on different surfaces, such as grass, clay, or hard court, each of which affects the speed and bounce of the ball </dd>
